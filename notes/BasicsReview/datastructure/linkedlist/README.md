# Linked Lists

## Defitions 
- Picture a linked list like a chain of paperclips linked together. It's quick to add another paperclip to the top or bottom. It's even quick to insert one in the middleâ€”just disconnect the chain at the middle link, add the new paperclip, then reconnect the other half.
- An item in a linked list is called a node. The first node is called the head. The last node is called the tail.
- **Doubly linked list** has nodes that also reference the previous node.

> Doubly linked lists allow us to traverse our list backwards. In a singly linked list, if you just had a pointer to a node in the middle of a list, there would be no way to know what nodes came before it. Not a problem in a doubly linked list.

- **Circularly linked list** is simple linked list whose tail, the last node, references the head, the first node.

> - Unlike an array, consecutive items in a linked list are not necessarily next to each other in memory.

## Strength 

- **Fast operations on the ends**: Adding elements at either end of a linked list is O(1)O(1). Removing the first element is also O(1)O(1).
- **Flexible size**: There's no need to specify how many elements you're going to store ahead of time. You can keep adding elements as long as there's enough space on the machine.

## Weaknesses

- **Costly lookups/access element**: To access or edit an item in a linked list, you have to take O(i) time to walk from the head of the list to the ith item.
- **Not cache-friendly**: Most computers have caching systems that make reading from sequential addresses in memory faster than reading from scattered addresses. **Array** items are always located right next to each other in computer memory, but linked list nodes can be scattered all over. So iterating through a linked list is usually quite a bit slower than iterating through the items in an array, even though they're both theoretically O(n) time.


## Uses

- Stacks and queues only need fast operations on the ends, so linked lists are ideal.

## Implementation: 
### Python 
```python 
# Node class 
class Node: 
   
    # Function to initialize the node object 
    def __init__(self, data): 
        self.data = data  # Assign data 
        self.next = None  # Initialize  
                          # next as null 
   
# Linked List class 
class LinkedList: 
     
    # Function to initialize the Linked  
    # List object 
    def __init__(self):  
        self.head = None
```

### Java 
```java

class LinkedList { 
    Node head; // head of the list 
  
    /* Linked list Node*/
    class Node { 
        int data; 
        Node next; 
        // Constructor to create a new node 
        // Next is by default initialized 
        // as null 
        Node(int d) { data = d; } 
    } 
}
```

<summary><b>Traversals</b></summary>

```java 
// A simple Java program for traversal of a linked list 
class LinkedList { 
    Node head; // head of list 
  
    /* Linked list Node.  This inner class is made static so that 
       main() can access it */
    static class Node { 
        int data; 
        Node next; 
        Node(int d) 
        { 
            data = d; 
            next = null; 
        } // Constructor 
    } 
  
    /* This function prints contents of linked list starting from head */
    public void printList() 
    { 
        Node n = head; 
        while (n != null) { 
            System.out.print(n.data + " "); 
            n = n.next; 
        } 
    } 
  
    /* method to create a simple linked list with 3 nodes*/
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
        /* Start with the empty list. */
        LinkedList llist = new LinkedList(); 
  
        llist.head = new Node(1); 
        Node second = new Node(2); 
        Node third = new Node(3); 
  
        llist.head.next = second; // Link first node with the second node 
        second.next = third; // Link first node with the second node 
  
        llist.printList(); 
    } 
}
```

## Linked list v.s array 
### PROS
- **Dynamic size**: The size of the arrays is fixed: So we must know the upper limit on the number of elements in advance. Also, generally, the allocated memory is equal to the upper limit irrespective of the usage.

- **Ease of insertion/deletion** :Inserting a new element in an array of elements is expensive because the room has to be created for the new elements and to create room existing elements have to be shifted.

### CONS 
- **Random access is not allowed**: We have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node. So we cannot do binary search with linked lists efficiently with its default implementation. 
- **Extra memory space for a pointer** is required with each element of the list.
- **Not cache friendly**: Since array elements are contiguous locations, there is locality of reference which is not there in case of linked lists.
