Comment: There are so much overlaps in between greedy, dp with graph theory. Say for example Dijkstra, Prim's and Kruskal's Minimum Spanning tree are just Greedy Algorithms or backtracking is just DFS with branch pruning with condition. So you will find it a lot easier after studying programming paradigm section. In fact graph problems are either so easy to recognize that everything is given so explicitly that any one can recognize it as a typical graph question or may be it's too hidden to even think it as a graph question. So my suggestion is to think out of the box for a problem, think if a problem can be solved by using graphs. **Never forget that, Interviewers are just obsessed with binary tree, so try to solve as many questions as you can related to tree, specifically binary tree(and also n-ary tree). And also solve at least 20 questions with tag BFS and DFS in Leetcode which will definitely boost your tree and graph problem solving skill as graph traversal is the main toolkit to solve tree/graph problems in interview. That's all about graph.**
