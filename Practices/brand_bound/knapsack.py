0/1 Knapsack problem using BnB 
Def: Given n items with Benfits b1,b2,b3,... bn and Weights w1,w2...wn. And
maximum capacity of knapsack M.

Objectives: Find the items that should be chosen that maximises benefit. (i.e
you can either choose or not choose item m)


Branch and Bound 
The backtracking based solution works better thanbrute force by ignoring
infeasible solutions. We can do better (than backtracking) if we know a bound on
best possible solution subtree rooted with every node. If the best in subtree is
worse than current best, we can simply ignore this node and its subtrees. So we
compute bound (best solution) for every node and compare the bound with current
best solution before exploring the node.

How to find bound for every node for 0/1 Knapsack?
The idea is to use the fact that the Greedy approach provides the best solution
for Fractional Knapsack problem. To check if a particular node can give us a
better solution or not, we compute the optimal solution (through the node) using
Greedy approach. If the solution computed by Greedy approach itself is more than
the best so far, then we canâ€™t get a better solution through the node.

Illustration 
Input:
// First thing in every pair is weight of item and second thing is value of item
Item arr[] = {{2, 40}, {3.14, 50}, {1.98, 100},{5, 95}, {3, 30}};
Knapsack Capacity W = 10

Output:
The maximum possible profit = 235

Items are considered sorted by value/weight.

This solution using iterative and priority queue , rather than recursive method.
The reason why i didn't use recursive is because we should always keep nodes for
different level.  I didn't figure out how to do this recursively
