## Operational Programming Problems
Some companies won't ask you algorithm problems. Instead, they might focus more on implementation and operational problems. These are usually more niche and involve practical problems, like looping through data and performing a task of some sort. These types of problems don't usually require as much practice because it is more about taking basic concepts like arrays and HashMaps and keeping track of what you are doing to them.
