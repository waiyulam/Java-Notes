# 🏎 Interview-Prep-Guide
Interviewing can be tough because you can feel like you are making no progress. Having this study guide will help you track your progress and give you a better read on how you are doing! Don't Rush. Enjoy the journey. Try to be a natural problem solver not a interview acing problem solver. And you are not alone!  

**Keep moving mate, never ever dare to give up. Hard work is going to pay you off very soon.**

<b><details><summary>👀 ABOUTS</summary></b>	

🕵 This repository is a summary of the basic knowledge of recruiting job seekers and beginners in the direction of SDE, including programming language, data structure, algorithm, programming paradigm, system, network and other domain knowledge 

Due to my limited level, the knowledge points in the warehouse are from my original, reading notes, books, blog posts, etc. Non-original has been marked with the source, if there is any omission, please issue an issue.

<b><details><summary>🔑 KEY TO SUCCEED</summary></b>	

## 🏁 Deliberate Strategic : Practice (KEY TO SUCCEED)
- **Retaining Computer Science Knowledge**
1. Review cs fundamentatals and summarize
2. Start doing coding interview questions while you're learning data structures and algorithms. 
3. Review and review 
 
- **Keep Practics**
1. Use Leetcode to practices different problems 
2. Take a break from programming problems for a half hour and go through your flashcards.

## 💻 Coding problem practices
- **Gathering requirements** : consider the constraint for the problem and its edge cases 
- **Problem recognition** : where the right data structures and algorithms fit in
- **Brain storm** : talking your way through the solution like you will in the interview including performance analysis 
- **Testing your solutions**

</details>


## 📅 Daily Plan 
1. CS Foundamentals Prep 
	- Take one subject from the list below, watch videos about that subject, and write an implementation 
	- Practices : [Implementation Category of Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms?filters%5Bsubdomains%5D%5B%5D=implementation&badge_type=problem-solving)
	- Each subjet should implement in at least 10 questions (Java / Python )
	
2. Run with practice problems 
	- Leetcode ( Eash -> **Medium** -> Hard )
	- Make use of built-in types
	- Each problems should follow the [strategics](https://github.com/waiyulam/Interview-Prep-Guide/tree/master/Leetcode)

## Conclusion
```java 
While 1:
	print("Deliberate Strategic Practice")
	print("Study and implement New DSA")
	print("Simulate real environement and test yourself") # do contest, contest and contest
```
The secret is nothing but **Regular Deliberate Strategic Practice**. We always try to solve questions beyond our comfort zone and do it regularly. And that is it really. Always solve questions that we are not comfortable with, push yourself. Try to solve topic wise after we get a good general grasp of DSA. Find your weakness and work on it. Hard work will pay you off one day. Just want to finish with one of my favorite quote by Mark Manson:

""I wanted the reward and not the struggle. I wanted the result and not the process. I was in love not with the fight but only the victory. And life doesn't work that way.""
